//  SynthMiner  --  blocks that remember more than a byte
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  THE THIRD TIER (chunk.h). A cell is a block id and a state byte, and
//  that is enough for most of the world -- which way a sign faces, how
//  grown a crop is, who placed a log. It is nowhere near enough for a
//  furnace, which has to remember three stacks of items, how much fuel
//  is still alight and how far through the current item it is.
//
//  So those blocks get a SIDE RECORD, keyed by where they stand and
//  saved with the chunk they are in (chunk_codec.h,
//  SECTION_BLOCK_ENTITIES -- a section reserved when the format was
//  designed and, until the furnace, never written to).
//
//  A FIXED GLOBAL POOL, NOT A LIST PER CHUNK. The decode runs on the
//  core-1 worker and Part K's contract is that the worker does not
//  allocate; a pool taken once at world open means a chunk arriving
//  never has to. Records find their chunk by their own coordinates, and
//  BE_MAX of them across the resident ring is far more containers than
//  anyone will build within sight of themselves.
//
//  THE RACE THAT ISN'T. The worker serialises a chunk's records while
//  the main task could in principle be stirring a furnace. It cannot:
//  a chunk is only saved when it is being evicted or when the world is
//  being saved, and a furnace can only be opened when the player is
//  standing next to it -- which is to say in a chunk that is resident
//  and nowhere near eviction. The residency contract already separates
//  them, so there is no lock here and should not be one.
//
//  Pure: no engine, no RTOS. The one allocation goes through psram.h,
//  which is the sanctioned seam. tools/worldcheck.c builds it as-is.
