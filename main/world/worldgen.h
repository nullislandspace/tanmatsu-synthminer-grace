//  SynthMiner  --  terrain generation
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  A chunk's terrain is a pure function of (seed, cx, cz). Nothing here
//  reads another chunk, reads the clock, or draws from anything but a
//  seeded hash -- so a world is reproducible from its seed for ever,
//  and the order chunks happen to be generated in cannot change what
//  they contain. That is determinism rule 3
//  (claudeplans/synthminer.md, Part T), and it is what the host check
//  `worldgen: cross-chunk equivalence` exists to defend.
//
//  DECORATIONS SPAN CHUNKS. A tree rooted near a chunk's edge has
//  branches in the next one. Rather than let a chunk read its
//  neighbour (which would make the result depend on load order), every
//  chunk walks the candidate tree positions of the 3 x 3 neighbourhood
//  around it and writes only the cells that land inside itself. Each
//  chunk therefore reaches the same answer alone as it would in company.
//
//  Pure: no engine, no RTOS, no allocation.
// =====================================================================

// Fill `c`'s id and st planes with the terrain of its own coordinates.
// The chunk must already carry cx / cz (chunk_claim sets them). Marks
// CF_GENERATED and refreshes the column summaries; leaves cstate alone
// (the caller owns the state machine).
//
// `farlands_x` is the world's Far Lands edge (world_meta_t.farlands_x,
// farlands.h): chunks wholly west of it are Far Lands. FARLANDS_NONE for
// a world without them.
// Force the bottom layer of a chunk to unbreakable bedrock, whatever is
// there. Idempotent, and cheap -- 256 cells.
//
// Called at the END of generation, after every generator has had its
// say, AND on every chunk that arrives from the card. The second is how
// a world written before this existed repairs itself: there is no
// version bump and no migration pass, because the format's rule (D-30)
// is that a world upgrades gradually as its chunks are written back,
// and every resident chunk is now written back (chunk_worker.c).

// --- Biomes -----------------------------------------------------------
//
// A FOURTH REGISTRY, and for the same reason as the other three: adding
// a place is a row, not an edit in five functions. Before this, every
// column in the world was grass over dirt with the same chance of a
// tree and the same three flowers -- a forest, a plain and a hillside
// differed only in how high they were.
//
// Chosen from two broad, slow fields (temperature and humidity) the way
// Minecraft chooses, and NOT from the height field: a biome that
// followed the terrain would put the same place on every hilltop.
//
// THE TERRAIN IS BLENDED AND THE SURFACE IS NOT, and that difference
// is the whole design. A biome id is a step function, so height taken
// from a lookup would put a vertical cliff at every border. What is
// blended instead is the WEIGHTS: each biome's membership is a smooth
// function of temperature and humidity, the three height numbers are
// mixed by those weights, and the ground comes out continuous because
// every term in it is. The surface BLOCK still changes abruptly, which
// is right -- grass meets sand at a line in every game that has both.
//
// It costs four multiplies on two noise values the column already
// needed. The obvious alternative -- sample the biome at a grid of
// offsets and average -- would be 25 lookups and 50 noise fields per
// column, and this world already spends 134 ms a chunk.
