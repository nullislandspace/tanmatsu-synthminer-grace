//  SynthMiner  --  chunks and the resident world
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  The world is unbounded in x and z and 64 blocks tall. It exists on
//  disk as generated-and-edited chunks and in memory as the few hundred
//  around the player. This file owns that resident set and is the only
//  way anything reads or writes a block.
//
//  LAYOUT. Two parallel planes of one byte per cell, column-major --
//  the same order voxel_mesh.c wants, so a chunk's own bytes can be
//  copied into the mesher's grid a column at a time and `vox_grid_t`
//  never changes (D-12).
//
//  THE STORE is a 16x16 ring indexed by the low bits of the chunk
//  coordinates, with the full coordinates stored alongside and checked
//  on every lookup (D-13). world_block() is the hottest function in the
//  program -- the mesher's border fetches, collision, block picking and
//  the tree flood-fill all go through it -- and this makes it two ANDs
//  and a compare. A chunk whose slot has been taken over by another
//  simply reads as absent, which is safe because eviction runs two
//  chunks further out than loading (hysteresis), so a wanted slot is
//  free before it is wanted.
//
//  NOT RESIDENT READS AS BLK_BARRIER (D-14): solid and unbreakable. The
//  player stops at the edge of the generated world instead of falling
//  through it, and no caller needs a "might be missing" branch.
//
//  THREADING. Only the main task writes `id` / `st` of a CS_READY
//  chunk; the core-1 worker writes them only while CS_LOADING, when
//  nothing else may look. See claudeplans/synthminer.md, Part K, for
//  the full ownership contract -- there are no locks on this path and
//  the rules are what keep it correct.
//
//  Pure: no engine, no RTOS. tools/worldcheck.c builds this as-is.

// 16 x 16 keeps VOX_CHUNK == 16, so the donor mesher's greedy mask
// sizing is unchanged. 64 tall is the compromise (D-11): the showreel's
// 32 leaves no room for mining under a build, and 128 doubles both the
// memory and the meshing for sky nobody visits.

//
// STORAGE is one 64-tall column (above). RENDERING is not: a chunk's
// mesh is cut into CH_SECT_N boxes of CH_SECT blocks, each with its own
// bounding box, so the frustum test can throw away the underground
// half instead of dragging it through the rasteriser. Measured cause:
// 68% of a chunk's triangles are cave walls nobody can see (F-33); the
// fix is D-34.
//
// This is a render-side split only. The planes, the codec, the region
// files and the save format all still see one column, and nothing on
// disk changes.
//
// 16 is the natural size: it matches x and z, it divides 64 exactly,
// and it is the granularity a block edit dirties -- placing a torch
// remeshes 4096 cells instead of 16384.

// --- The state byte ---------------------------------------------------
//
// One byte per cell, split one way for everybody and one way per block:
//
//   bit 0     ST_PLACED   universal, and the only bit with a fixed
//                         meaning across all blocks.
//   bits 1-7  block data  0..127, meaning belongs to the block type.
//
// That is the middle of three tiers, and the split matters because the
// tiers cost wildly different amounts:
//
//   1. THE BLOCK ID alone -- stone, dirt, planks. Most of the world.
//   2. ID + 7 BITS OF DATA -- a crop's growth stage, which way a stair
//      or a rail faces, a redstone wire's power, whether a furnace is
//      lit. 128 values is far more than the 4 bits Minecraft managed
//      with for years, and it costs nothing: the byte is already there
//      and RLEs to nothing, because it is zero almost everywhere.
//   3. A BLOCK ENTITY -- a furnace's three slots and its burn timer, a
//      chest's twenty-seven, a sign's text. Variable-sized, rare, and
//      so stored per chunk in a side list rather than per cell
//      (chunk_codec.h, SECTION_BLOCK_ENTITIES).
//
// Creatures and dropped items are not blocks at all and live in the
// chunk's entity list (SECTION_ENTITIES), which is how a cow stays in
// the field it was left in.
//
// Set on every block a player places, never by generation. The logging
// rule reads it: breaking a placed log drops that log, breaking a grown
// one fells the tree (claudeplans/synthminer.md, Part F). It also gives
// "placed leaves never decay" for free when decay arrives.
