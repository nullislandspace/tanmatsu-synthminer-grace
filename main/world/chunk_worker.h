//  SynthMiner  --  the background chunk task (core 1)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Core 0 runs the game and draws it; core 1 does the work that would
//  otherwise land in a frame: generating terrain, meshing it, and the
//  SD card. Measured, those are 56 ms, some tens of ms, and 6.6/21.5 ms
//  a chunk (F-23, F-26) -- none of which can happen between two frames.
//
//  THE OWNERSHIP CONTRACT, because there are no locks on this path:
//
//    id[]/st[] while CS_LOADING   the worker's. Main treats the chunk
//                                 as absent, so nothing reads them.
//    id[]/st[] while CS_READY     MAIN's. The worker only reads them,
//                                 to mesh or to save.
//    the meshes                   MAIN's. The worker builds a NEW mesh
//                                 in its own storage and hands the
//                                 whole struct over; main swaps the
//                                 pointer between frames. The renderer
//                                 can never see a half-built mesh
//                                 because the renderer IS main.
//    cstate                       main's. The worker reports what it
//                                 finished; main decides what that
//                                 means.
//
//  A mesh result carries the `edit_seq` its chunk had when the job was
//  queued. If the chunk has been edited since, the mesh is stale and is
//  dropped rather than shown.
//
//  SYNCHRONOUS MODE runs every job inline on the calling task. The
//  `shots` test needs it (a frame must be a pure function of the show
//  clock), and so does entering a world, where the 3 x 3 around the
//  player has to exist before the first tick (D-15, D-26).
