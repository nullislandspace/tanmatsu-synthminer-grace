//  SynthMiner  --  the block registry
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  ONE table describes every block: how it meshes, how it looks, how
//  long it takes to break, what it drops, and how it behaves. The mesher
//  (voxel/voxel_mesh.c), the collider, the picker and the interaction
//  code all read it and none of them has a switch over block ids.
//
//  Adding a block is: one row here, one BLK_ id below, one 16x16 PNG
//  (plus its VM_ material and its row in MAT_FILES), one metadata.json
//  line. Nothing else. That is the whole extendability contract
//  (claudeplans/synthminer.md, Part L).
//
//  Pure: no engine, no RTOS, no allocation. tools/worldcheck.c compiles
//  this as-is.

// The Use key OPENS this block instead of placing against it: a
// crafting table, and later a furnace, a chest and the benches. The
// player only reports which block was used -- what a screen is and
// how to show one is main.c's business, not the registry's.
//

// THE BLOCK WILL NOT BREAK AT ALL without a tool of at least its
// `tool_level`. Minecraft's rule is that it breaks and drops nothing,
// and this game used that until iron arrived -- the user asked for the
// stricter one (2026-09-23), so iron ore refuses the swing outright.
//
// A refusal has to SAY SO, or a swing that does nothing and explains
// nothing reads as a bug -- which is exactly why Minecraft chose the
// other rule. See break_result_t.needs_tool.

// fill spreads through -- leaves are fellable and are NOT trunks.
//
// They were one flag until 2026-09-28, and breaking a single leaf
// therefore brought the whole tree down, which is not what anyone
// wants from clearing a canopy. The two ideas had looked like one
// because logs are the only thing that is both.
#define BF2_TRUNK      (1u << 3)

// THE BLOCK STANDS ON THE ONE BELOW IT, and a stack of them falls as a
// unit: take one out and everything of the same kind directly above
// comes down with it. Cactus, and sugar cane when it arrives.
//
// This is SUPPORT, not the felling rule, and the difference matters in
// two places. It does not care who put the block there -- physics has
// no opinion about ST_PLACED -- and it goes straight up one column
// rather than flooding through a shape.
//
// It is also a stand-in. Properly this is a block update: remove a
// block, tell the neighbours, let each decide whether it can still
// stand. Water, falling sand and the torch that step 29 left hanging in
// mid-air all want the same machinery, and when it exists this flag
// becomes one of its rules instead of a special case in interact.c.

// changes, its NAME never changes (a world's palette matches blocks by
// name when it opens), and it is never deleted: a block the game stops
// using is RETIRED -- it keeps its row and its number, and nothing else
// ever gets that number. New blocks go at the END, with the next free id,
// wherever they belong in a menu.
//
// tools/ids.txt lists every id and name ever shipped, and `make check`
