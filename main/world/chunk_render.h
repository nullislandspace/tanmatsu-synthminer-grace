//  Each frame, for every chunk that should be resident: keep it loaded,
//  keep a level of detail meshed, and submit the ones the camera can
//  see. By distance from the eye (the ladder is the showreel's, whose
//  numbers were measured, F-03/F-04):
//
//    within fancy_dist   everything, textured: canopies you see into,
//                        plants
//    within tex_dist     textured, canopies opaque, no plants
//    within coarse_dist  flat mean colours fading to fog -- 3-4x cheaper
//                        to fill than textures
//    within draw_dist    the same at half resolution, a quarter of the
//                        triangles
//    beyond              nothing; the backdrop's fog-coloured ground is
//                        the world out there
//
//  THE RENDER ORIGIN. Everything is submitted relative to an integer
//  origin near the player, so the floats reaching the rasteriser stay
//  small and exact however far they have walked (D-01). The camera must
//  be set in the same space -- chunk_render_origin() is what puts it
//  there.
