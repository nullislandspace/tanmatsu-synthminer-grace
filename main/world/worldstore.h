//  SynthMiner  --  worlds on the SD card
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  A world is a directory: its metadata and the player in `level.smw`,
//  its terrain in `region/r.<rx>.<rz>.smr`. This owns creating, listing,
//  opening, saving and deleting them, and is the only thing that knows
//  where any of it lives -- the chunk worker asks for a chunk, not for
//  a path.
//
//      <base>/worlds/worlds.idx          an index, an optimisation only
//      <base>/worlds/<slug>/level.smw    metadata + player, NBT
//      <base>/worlds/<slug>/region/...   terrain
//
//  BOTH FORMATS ARE BUILT TO GROW. That is a requirement, not a nicety:
//  this game will gain player attributes and block types for as long as
//  anyone works on it, and a save that cannot survive that is a save
//  that gets thrown away.
//
//  Player state grows by NBT's nature. Every field is a named, typed
//  tag; the reader defaults the whole struct first, then loops the tags
//  it finds, dispatches the ones it knows and SKIPS the rest
//  (nbt_skip_payload). So an old save loads into a new build with the
//  new fields at their defaults, and a new save loads into an old build
//  with the unknown fields ignored. Adding an attribute is one line in
//  the writer and one case in the reader.
//
//  Block ids grow through a PALETTE. The chunk planes store one byte per
//  cell, so a saved id only means anything next to the table that was
//  current when it was written. `level.smw` therefore records that
//  table: every block's NAME against the id it had. On open, each name
//  is looked up in today's registry and a remap is built, which
//  chunk_decode applies as it unpacks (chunk_codec.h). Blocks can then
//  be added anywhere, reordered, or removed, and old worlds still load.
//  A name this build no longer has becomes air, and the count is
//  reported rather than hidden.
