//  SynthMiner  --  the game's own settings
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  What the Graphics, Audio and Controls menus change -- key bindings
//  included -- in ONE TEXT FILE ON THE SD CARD, next to the worlds:
//
//      /sd/synthminer/settings.txt
//
//  so copying that directory backs up a player's worlds and their
//  settings together (D-67). Not the app's install directory: the
//  launcher owns that, and may empty it on an update (datadir.h, D-80). It is plain `key=value` lines: readable, and
//  fixable by hand if it ever needs to be. Unknown keys are ignored and
//  missing ones keep their defaults, so the file survives settings being
//  added and removed, the way level.smw survives new tags.
//
//  NOT here: volume and the three brightnesses. Those are the device's,
//  shared with the launcher and every other app, and se_hw.h owns them;
//  the menus call it directly. A game keeping its own copy of the volume
//  is how a badge ends up loud in one app and silent in the next.
//
//  Each change rewrites the file at once. A setting is changed by a
//  person pressing a key in a menu, a few times a session at most, so
//  there is nothing to batch. The rewrite goes to settings.tmp first and
//  is renamed over the old file, so a badge switched off mid-write keeps
//  one whole copy or the other.
