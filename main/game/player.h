//  A body (physics.h), a direction to look, and what the two of them do
//  with a tick's worth of input. Health, hunger and the inventory are
//  block 4; this is walking, jumping, looking, breaking and placing.
//
//  IT TICKS AT 20 Hz AND THE FRAME INTERPOLATES (D-02). player_tick()
//  advances the simulation by exactly one tick from a bitmask;
//  player_eye() blends the last two poses for the frame being drawn.
//  That is what makes the movement the same at 10 fps and at 30, and
//  what makes a recorded bitmask stream replay to the same world.
//
//  SPEEDS ARE PER TICK, not per second, for the same reason: a number
//  that means "per tick" cannot silently acquire a frame-rate
//  dependency later.

// The jump arc. These three are chosen together, by simulating the arc
// rather than by feel, because what matters is a number you can state:
//
//   apex 1.33 blocks, 0.40 s up, 0.85 s in the air.
//
// The apex has to clear a block WITH ROOM, or you cannot place one
// underneath yourself -- and pillaring up is how you get out of a hole,
// so it is not a trick, it is basic movement. 1.33 leaves a third of a
// block of margin at the top for the placement to happen in.
//
// Slower than Minecraft (0.60 s in the air) on purpose: at 15 fps a
// 0.60 s jump is nine frames from take-off to landing, and judging a
// landing in nine frames is not fair on the player. Same apex, longer
// arc -- which is the pair (v0 * k, g * k^2), here with k = 0.7.

// SWIMMING (D-86). Water is not solid, so a player in it falls -- but
// slowly, because buoyancy cancels almost all of gravity, and they can
// push themselves back up. The numbers follow from phys_gravity's
// recurrence `vy = (vy - g) * drag` rather than from feel:
//
//   sinking, hands down:  4 * (0 - 0.008)         = -0.032/tick, 0.6 b/s
//   swimming up:          4 * (0.030 - 0.008)     = +0.088/tick, 1.8 b/s
//   diving:               4 * (-0.030 - 0.008)    = -0.152/tick, 3.0 b/s
//
// (the 4 is drag/(1 - drag) with drag = 0.8.) Jump swims up and sneak
// dives, which is free because the speed in water does not depend on
// sneaking the way it does on land.
#define PL_SWIM       0.11f   // blocks a tick: about half a walk
#define PL_SWIM_UP    0.030f  // added to vy per tick while jump (or sneak) is held
