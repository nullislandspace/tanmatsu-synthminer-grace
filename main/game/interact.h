//  SynthMiner  --  breaking and placing
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  THE LOGGING RULE (claudeplans/synthminer.md, Part F) lives here, and
//  it is SynthMiner's one deliberate departure from Minecraft:
//
//    break a TRUNK the world GREW                  -> the tree falls
//    break a trunk the PLAYER placed               -> that block drops
//    break a LEAF, however it got there            -> that leaf drops
//
//  Only a trunk starts a fell. Leaves are tree material -- the fell
//  SPREADS through them, so a canopy still comes down with its trunk --
//  but cutting one is an ordinary break. Until 2026-09-28 both tests
//  were the same flag, so clearing a canopy by hand felled the tree out
//  from under it (BF2_TRUNK, blocks.h).
//
//  Which is which is the ST_PLACED bit, set on everything a player puts
//  down and never by generation (chunk.h). So a forest can be cleared
//  without twenty minutes of jumping at trunks, and a player's own
//  timber-framed house does not collapse when they mis-click a beam.
//
//  Felling is a flood fill through GROWN tree blocks only, and it is
//  bounded three ways, all of which matter:
//
//    * y >= the broken block's y -- so breaking a trunk at head height
//      does not take the stump you are standing on, and a tree growing
//      out of a cliff does not reach down it;
//    * FELL_RADIUS horizontally and FELL_HEIGHT up -- so one tree whose
//      canopy touches another cannot take the whole forest;
//    * FELL_MAX blocks in total -- a hard stop, so a pathological shape
//      cannot stall a tick however the other two are tuned.
//
//  Pure: no engine, no allocation (the fill has a fixed-size stack).
//  tools/worldcheck.c tests the rule both ways.
