//  SynthMiner  --  what is drawn over the world
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Two things, and both exist for the same reason: without them you
//  cannot tell what you are about to hit.
//
//    the crosshair    where the ray goes
//    the outline      the block it found
//
//  THE CROSSHAIR IS NOT AT THE CENTRE OF THE SCREEN. The engine
//  projects the camera's forward axis to (RENDER_HALF_W,
//  RENDER_HORIZON_Y), and RENDER_HORIZON_Y is 256 on a 480-row display,
//  not 240 (se_config.h -- a game can move its horizon). Drawing the
//  crosshair at the geometric centre would put it sixteen pixels below
//  where the pick actually points, which is exactly the kind of aiming
//  error nobody thinks to suspect. It is derived from the projection
//  constants instead, so it follows if they ever change.
//
//  Block 4 adds the hotbar, the hearts and the hunger row here.

// triangles.

// Exposed because the chest screen needs TWO of them side by side, and
// a second copy of "box, frame, icon, count" would be a second place
// for the slot to stop looking like a slot.
//
// `cursor` is the slot to ring in yellow, or -1 for none; `active`
// dims the whole grid when the cursor is on the other one, which is
// what tells a player which side the arrow keys belong to.
