//  SynthMiner  --  a body moving through blocks
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  An axis-aligned box swept against the voxel world. The player is one
//  of these; so is every animal and mob later, which is why nothing
//  here knows what a player is.
//
//  AXIS AT A TIME, IN SUB-STEPS. Each axis is moved and resolved on its
//  own -- the standard voxel approach, and the reason a body slides
//  along a wall instead of stopping dead against it. Each move is cut
//  into steps no longer than PHYS_SUBSTEP so that nothing can pass
//  through a block between two samples, however fast it is going. That
//  matters more here than in most games: a fall from build height
//  reaches 0.9 blocks a tick, which is more than half the player's own
//  height.
//
//  STEP-UP is what makes a one-block rise walkable without jumping. A
//  body that is blocked horizontally AND standing on something tries
//  the same move again from up to PHYS_STEP higher, and keeps it only
//  if that succeeds and it can settle back down.
//
//  AN UNLOADED CHUNK IS SOLID (D-14), because world_block() says so.
//  The player walks to the edge of the generated world and stops, which
//  is the behaviour that needs no special case anywhere else.
//
//  Pure: no engine, no RTOS, no allocation. tools/worldcheck.c runs the
//  collision tests against this directly.

// How high a body walks up without jumping. A WHOLE BLOCK, which is a
// deliberate difference from Minecraft's 0.6 -- there it buys stairs
// and slabs and nothing else, and you jump for a full block.
//
// This is a handheld with a keyboard and no mouse. Having to tap jump
// at every clod of terrain is tiring in a way it is not with a hand
// already on a mouse, and there are no stairs yet for 0.6 to be the
// right number for. Walls are still walls: a step is only kept if the
// body can settle onto something afterwards, so two blocks stops you.
#define PHYS_STEP 1.0f
#define PHYS_SKIN    0.001 // gap left at a contact face, so "touching" is never "inside"

// SNEAKING, as far as a body is concerned: two rules, both off by
// default, and neither of them knows that a player is what turns them
// on (game/player.c).
//
//   step_up == 0   it climbs nothing without jumping
//   edge_stop      it will not walk off what is holding it up
//
// The second is Minecraft's, and it is the one that makes building out
// over a drop possible at all: you walk backwards to the lip, stop
// dead, and place the next block under your own feet. Implemented as a
// question asked BEFORE each sub-step rather than a position undone
// afterwards -- undoing it puts the body back where it started, which
// at a walk is a quarter of a block short of the edge, and the whole
// point is to be able to stand ON the edge.
//
// How close to the lip you end up is how finely that question is asked:
// the sub-step is halved PHYS_EDGE_HALVINGS times before the move is
// given up, so the gap left is the tick's move over eight -- under a
// hundredth of a block at a sneak, which is less than the skin.

// which costs a third of the height -- the same three constants give
// an apex of 0.83 blocks that way and 1.33 this way, and nothing in
// the code says so. Stated once, here, where the host test and the
// player both call it.

// standing still accumulates fall speed and shoots off the moment the
// floor is broken out from under it.
