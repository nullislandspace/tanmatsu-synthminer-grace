//  SynthMiner  --  the app skeleton
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  The whole app for now: one block turning in front of the camera, lit
//  by a sun. It is here to prove the shape of an engine app end to end
//  -- run loop, scene, lighting, input -- and to be the thing the block
//  world grows out of.
//
//  The engine owns the loop (se_run): device bootstrap, the frame clock,
//  the input pump, the device-global keys, vsync and the blit. This file
//  is content plus per-frame logic, which is the whole point of the
//  inversion: see synthengine3D/docs/architecture.md.
//
//  What is deliberately NOT here yet: the world, a mesh builder,
//  textures, a camera that moves with the player. Those arrive with the
//  game.
