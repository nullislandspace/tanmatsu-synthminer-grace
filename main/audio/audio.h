//  SynthMiner  --  the audio system's lifetime
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  The engine's mixer (se_audio.h) owns the one I2S channel and sleeps
//  the amplifier when nothing is playing. This file starts it, stops it,
//  and is where the game asks for the things that are not a single
//  effect: the walking sounds, which need to know how far the feet have
//  travelled, and the music, which needs to know how long the silence
//  has lasted.
//
//  Effects themselves are sfx.h; the music is music.h. Neither is
//  reachable before sm_audio_init(), and both are silent rather than
//  broken if it failed -- a badge whose speaker will not start still
//  plays the game.
