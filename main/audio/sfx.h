//  SynthMiner  --  the sound effects
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Every sound the game makes is ONE ROW in a table (sfx.c), not one
//  file per noise. The synthracer pattern this is descended from gave
//  each effect its own module -- right when there are seven of them and
//  each is a different idea, wrong here, where a footstep on gravel and
//  a footstep on sand are the same idea with different numbers.
//
//  So: `sfx_def_t` describes a one-shot as a tone layer plus a noise
//  layer through a filter, with an attack/decay envelope and a pitch
//  sweep. That covers a footstep, a pick striking stone, glass
//  breaking, an item picked up and a player hurt. A sound that genuinely
//  cannot be said in those terms gets its own voice module next to this
//  one -- but none of the first dozen needed to.
//
//  WHICH sound a block makes is the block registry's business, not this
//  file's: `block_def_t.sound` names a material class (SND_STONE,
//  SND_WOOD, ...) and the step / break / place sounds follow from it.
//  Adding a block therefore adds its sounds too, in the same row, with
//  no edit here (claudeplans/synthminer.md, Part L).
//
//  Every voice is registered with the engine mixer and frees itself when
//  its envelope closes. Playing is fire-and-forget and never blocks; if
//  the mixer is full the sound is simply dropped, because a missing
//  footstep is better than a stalled tick.
