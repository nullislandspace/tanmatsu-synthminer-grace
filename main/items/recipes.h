// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  A THIRD TABLE, like blocks.h and items.h, and adding a recipe is a
//  row. See claudeplans/synthminer.md, Part C, for the design; the two
//  things worth knowing before reading this file:
//
//  1. A RECIPE IS A MULTISET, NOT A GRID. The badge has a keyboard and
//     no pointer, so crafting is a searchable book rather than nine
//     cells you drag things into (the user's call, 2026-09-23). With no
//     grid the SHAPE of a recipe is not merely unused, it is
//     unobservable -- there is no surface on which a player could see
//     or express it. So there is no w, no h, no in[9] and no offsets,
//     and a pickaxe and an axe are free to want the same three planks
//     and two sticks, as they do in Minecraft. Nothing here ever infers
//     a recipe from a pile of ingredients: forward, the player names
//     it; backward, the disassembly bench starts from the item.
//
//  2. QUANTITIES ARE MINECRAFT'S, as asked.
//
//  Pure: no engine, no allocation. tools/worldcheck.c builds it as-is.

// a bit per item, in the inventory (inventory.h, inv_seen), set by
// inv_add -- because a bitmask over RECIPES would make recipe numbering
// permanent the way block ids are (D-74) and would need a migration
// every time a recipe was inserted. Item names are already what saves
// key on. A recipe added by a later build is then correctly already
