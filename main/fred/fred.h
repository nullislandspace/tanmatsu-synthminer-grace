//  SynthMiner  --  Fred
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  The player's figure: seen whole in third person, and as his right arm
//  and whatever it holds in first person. Posed as a pure function of a
//  fred_pose_t, so nothing is kept between frames; the meshes are
//  fred_mesh.h's.
//
//  Ported from tanmatsu-showreel-grace, main/craftminer/assets/miner.h,
//  where he was "the miner" and only ever held a pickaxe or a block.
//  Here he holds what the player's hotbar holds -- any of three tools in
//  two materials, a block in its own textures, or an item -- and he is
//  lit by the cell he stands in, so he goes dark at night and warm by a
//  torch like everything else. Changes are SynthMiner's; the showreel
//  stays the origin to diff against.
