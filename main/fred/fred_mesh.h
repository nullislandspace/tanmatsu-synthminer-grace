//  SynthMiner  --  Fred's meshes (engine-free)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Fred, the player's figure: a yellow hard hat with a lamp, a big
//  brown moustache, a red shirt, blue overalls, brown boots -- and a
//  pickaxe, an axe or a shovel in his fist.
//  One mesh per moving piece, each built round its joint so a pose is a
//  rotation about the origin (miner.c):
//
//    head   neck at the origin; the hat, its brim and the lamp on it
//    body   hips at the origin, shoulders at y = FRED_BODY_H
//    arm    shoulder at the origin, hanging down -y
//    leg    hip at the origin, hanging down -y
//    pick   held in the fist: the handle along +z, the head at its end
//
//  Model units are blocks, +y up, the figure facing +z (its right hand
//  on -x). About 2 blocks tall; fred.c scales it to 0.9.
//  Ported from tanmatsu-showreel-grace,
//  main/craftminer/assets/miner_mesh.h, where he was "the miner".
//  Changes here are SynthMiner's; the showreel stays the origin to diff
//  against.
